# multimodal-fusion-contrastive-crossmodal-radiology-image-retrieval
This project explores multimodal learning for radiology image-caption retrieval using the ROCOv2 dataset. It implements and compares two key approaches—cross-modal attention–based fusion and contrastive dual-tower embeddings—covering model design, training, retrieval evaluation, scalability analysis, and Recall@K metrics.
